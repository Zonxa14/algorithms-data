/* Example:
1) Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Explanation: Looking at the first two intervals - 
    [1,3] and [2,6], since they overlap, they are merged as [1,6].

2) Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
    Output: [[1,5]]
    Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

Possible case
Range1, range2


1st: range1 is not overlapping with range2
2nd: [1,3],[2,6]
3rd: [1,4], [2,3]
