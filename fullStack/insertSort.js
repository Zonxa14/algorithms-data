/*Question 3) Implement insertion sort.
Build the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time.
The algorithm iterates the input elements by growing the
sorted array (on left subarray) at each iteration.
Has better performance than the selection and bubble sort
algorithms when sorting small arrays. Because on average case,
it performs half as many comparisons as selection or bubble sort algorithms.
