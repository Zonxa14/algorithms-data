Hashing is more art than science...

Every type of database uses some form of hashing
Dictionary and HashTable are the same thing

In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that 
implements an associative array abstract data type, 
a structure that can map keys to values.

A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, 
also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, 
from which the desired value can be found.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, 
but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, 
which might cause hash collisions where the hash function 
generates the same index for more than one key.

Such collisions are always accommodated in some way.

In a well-dimesnioned hash table, the average cost
(number of instructions) for each lookup is independent 
of the number of elements stored in the table.

Many hash tbale designs also allow arbitrary insertions 
and deletions of key-valye pairs, at (amortized) 
constant average cost per operation.

In many situations, hash tables turn out to be on average 
more efficient than search trees or any other table lookup structure.

For this reason, they are widely used in many kinds of computer software,
particularly for associate arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets.

Hashing is like cutting something into pieces and mixing them around.
